# Creative Waco Tools

Internal tools for Creative Waco, hosted at **https://tools.creativewaco.org**.

## Tools

| Tool | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| RSS Email HTML Generator | [/rss-email/](https://tools.creativewaco.org/rss-email/) | RSS feed → HubSpot-ready event email HTML |
| Event Card Graphics | [/event-cards/](https://tools.creativewaco.org/event-cards/) | Ticket-style Instagram carousel cards (1080px wide export) from the events RSS feed |
| Creative Spark Dashboard | [/sparks-dashboard/](https://tools.creativewaco.org/sparks-dashboard/) | Live Spark membership + event pipeline from Givebutter and Asana |
| UTM URL Builder | [/utm-builder/](https://tools.creativewaco.org/utm-builder/) | Build campaign-tagged links with UTM parameters for analytics |

## Architecture

Next.js 15 App Router app deployed on Vercel at **https://tools.creativewaco.org**. **Clerk** protects all pages and API routes except `/api/health/` (uptime checks). Sign in at `/sign-in/`; the sidebar footer shows the signed-in user with account and sign-out actions.

| Layer | Location |
|-------|----------|
| Pages | `app/` — hub, `/rss-email/`, `/event-cards/`, `/sparks-dashboard/`, `/utm-builder/` |
| API | `app/api/` — Route Handlers wrapping `lib/` |
| App shell | `components/AppShell.tsx` + `@shadcnblocks/application-shell2` — inset collapsible sidebar; all tools under one **Tools** group from `lib/tools-registry.ts` |
| UI components | `components/` — shadcn/ui primitives, shared layout, per-tool React clients |
| Backend logic | `lib/` — RSS generation, event cards, Givebutter/Asana dashboard |

Navigation is provided by the Application Shell 2 layout (inset sidebar with icon collapse). The sidebar lists **All tools** plus every registry entry under a single **Tools** group; the Creative Waco branding block at the top is display-only (use **All tools** or **⌘B** / **Ctrl+B** to collapse the sidebar). Collapsed vs expanded state is remembered for 7 days in a browser cookie. The hub at `/` and each tool page render inside the shell's main content area.

Favicon and Apple touch icon match [creativewaco.org](https://creativewaco.org/) (`app/icon.png`, `app/apple-icon.png`).

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Default dev server: **https://local.tools.creativewaco.org/** (HTTPS on port 443, production Clerk keys in `.env.local`). First run adds a hosts entry via `npm run setup:local-clerk` (sudo). Unauthenticated visits redirect to `/sign-in/`.

For **Development** instance keys on `http://localhost:3847`, use `npm run dev:3847` with [`.env.development.local`](.env.development.local.example) (see Clerk section below).

### Clerk (Creative Waco account)

This app uses a **dedicated Creative Waco Clerk application**. Do **not** reuse API keys from the Tortoise & Hare Clerk account or any other project.

**One-time setup**

1. Sign in at [dashboard.clerk.com](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) with the Creative Waco account (or create a new Clerk account for Creative Waco).
2. **Create application** → name it e.g. **Creative Waco Tools** (separate from Tortoise & Hare).
3. Copy keys from **Configure → API keys** into `.env.local` (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)).
4. Under **Configure → Paths**, set sign-in URL `/sign-in/` and sign-up URL `/sign-up/`.
5. Under **Configure → Domains**, add:
   - Development: `http://localhost:3847`
   - Production: `https://tools.creativewaco.org`
6. Restrict access for an internal tool — e.g. **User & authentication → Restrictions** to allowlist `@creativewaco.org`, or disable public sign-up and **invite** team members only.

**Do not** click **Configure your application** in the running dev app if you are logged into the Tortoise & Hare Clerk account — that would link this project to the wrong Clerk app. Always paste Creative Waco keys into the env files below.

#### Local development (two options)

Clerk **production** keys (`pk_live_`) do not work on `http://localhost:3847` — Clerk validates the request origin against your production domain.

**Option A — day-to-day dev with test keys** (`npm run dev:3847`)

1. Install the [Clerk CLI](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/clerk-cli/overview) (`npm install -g clerk`), then run `clerk auth login`, `clerk init --app app_3ErvN68yrbKMBYDQrUkPvkkkK1F`, or use the project wrapper: `npm run clerk auth login`.
2. Or manually: Clerk Dashboard → **Development** instance → **Configure → API keys** → copy into [`.env.development.local.example`](.env.development.local.example) as `.env.development.local`.
3. Run `npm run dev:3847` → [http://localhost:3847/sign-in/](http://localhost:3847/sign-in/)

Verification emails from the **Development** instance are prefixed `[Development]` and sent from `@accounts.dev`. Use [https://tools.creativewaco.org/sign-in/](https://tools.creativewaco.org/sign-in/) to test production email (no `[Development]` prefix).

**Clerk CLI in Cursor:** the global `clerk` command can hang in non-interactive shells. Use `npm run clerk -- <command>` (runs `scripts/clerk.sh`) or call the native binary with stdin closed.

**Access control:** Development instance allowlists `*@creativewaco.org` (sign-in and sign-up). Manage via Dashboard → **Configure → Restrictions** or `npm run clerk -- api allowlist_identifiers`.

**Option B — default local dev with production keys** (`npm run dev`)

Uses subdomain `local.tools.creativewaco.org` (Clerk allows subdomains of `tools.creativewaco.org`). Requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PROXY_URL` in `.env.local` (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)); middleware enables Frontend API proxy when that variable is set.

```bash
npm run setup:local-clerk   # one-time: 127.0.0.1 local.tools.creativewaco.org in /etc/hosts (sudo)
npm run dev                 # HTTPS on port 443 (sudo inside scripts/dev-local.sh)
```

Open [https://local.tools.creativewaco.org/sign-in/](https://local.tools.creativewaco.org/sign-in/) (accept the self-signed cert warning). Add this host to Google OAuth redirect URIs if testing Google sign-in locally.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Yes | `pk_test_…` in `.env.development.local`; `pk_live_…` in `.env.local` + Vercel |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | Matching secret for each instance |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PROXY_URL` | Local prod dev | e.g. `https://local.tools.creativewaco.org/__clerk/` when using Option B |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL` | No | Default `/sign-in/` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL` | No | Default `/sign-up/` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL` | No | Default `/` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL` | No | Default `/` |

For Vercel production, set the **Production** Clerk variables under **Settings → Environment Variables**.

#### Google sign-in (production)

Production Clerk requires **custom Google OAuth credentials** — Clerk’s shared dev credentials do not work on `pk_live_` instances.

**1. Clerk Dashboard** (Production instance selected)

1. Go to [Configure → SSO connections](https://dashboard.clerk.com/last-active?path=sso-connections).
2. **Add connection** → **For all users** → **Google**.
3. Enable **Enable for sign-up and sign-in** and **Use custom credentials**.
4. Copy the **Authorized redirect URI** shown in the modal (keep this page open).

**2. Google Cloud Console**

Use a Google Cloud project owned by Creative Waco (not Tortoise & Hare).

1. [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) → **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen** — configure app name (e.g. *Creative Waco Tools*), support email, and set **Publishing status** to **In production** when ready.
2. **Credentials** → **Create credentials** → **OAuth client ID** → **Web application**.
3. **Authorized JavaScript origins:**
   - `https://tools.creativewaco.org`
   - `http://localhost:3847` (local dev)
4. **Authorized redirect URIs:** paste the URI from Clerk (step 1.4). For production on `creativewaco.org`, this is typically `https://clerk.creativewaco.org/v1/oauth_callback`. For local dev (`npm run dev:3847`), also add your Development instance callback (shown in Clerk when **Development** is selected), e.g. `https://<instance>.clerk.accounts.dev/v1/oauth_callback`.
5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret**.

**3. Back in Clerk**

Paste the Google Client ID and Client secret into the Google connection → **Save**.

**4. Restrict who can sign in** (recommended for internal tools)

Production supports **Google** and **email code** sign-in (enter email → verification code; no password); middleware still rejects accounts whose email is not `@creativewaco.org`. In Google Cloud, set the OAuth consent screen **User type** to **Internal** if Creative Waco uses Google Workspace.

Development still uses Clerk’s email allowlist (`*@creativewaco.org`) when testing with `npm run dev:3847`.

#### Sign-in branding

The Clerk sign-in and sign-up pages use the Creative Waco horizontal logo from [`public/creative-waco-logo-horizontal.avif`](public/creative-waco-logo-horizontal.avif), configured in [`lib/clerk-appearance.ts`](lib/clerk-appearance.ts) on `ClerkProvider`.

No code changes are required — the existing `/sign-in/` page shows the Google button automatically once the connection is enabled.

#### Clerk DNS (Cloudflare)

Production Clerk for **Creative Waco Tools** (`app_3ErvN68yrbKMBYDQrUkPvkkkK1F`) uses the **creativewaco.org** apex domain. Add five **CNAME** records in the **creativewaco.org** Cloudflare zone. Set **Proxy status** to **DNS only** (grey cloud) for all of them.

| Name (Cloudflare) | Target |
|-------------------|--------|
| `clerk` | `frontend-api.clerk.services` |
| `accounts` | `accounts.clerk.services` |
| `clkmail` | `mail.3gh8t6w3hecc.clerk.services` |
| `clk._domainkey` | `dkim1.3gh8t6w3hecc.clerk.services` |
| `clk2._domainkey` | `dkim2.3gh8t6w3hecc.clerk.services` |

After adding records, click **Verify configuration** in the Clerk Dashboard (or run `npm run clerk -- deploy status --wait`). SSL certificates issue automatically once DNS verifies.

From the website repo (with `.cloudflare-env` configured):

```bash
cd ../website
source setup-cloudflare-env.sh
cf_dns_upsert clerk CNAME frontend-api.clerk.services false
cf_dns_upsert accounts CNAME accounts.clerk.services false
cf_dns_upsert clkmail CNAME mail.3gh8t6w3hecc.clerk.services false
cf_dns_upsert clk._domainkey CNAME dkim1.3gh8t6w3hecc.clerk.services false
cf_dns_upsert clk2._domainkey CNAME dkim2.3gh8t6w3hecc.clerk.services false
```

Or use **Cloudflare Dashboard** → **DNS** → **Add record** for each row.

### shadcn/ui and Shadcnblocks

The app uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) with the Application Shell 2 block from [Shadcnblocks](https://www.shadcnblocks.com/). Configuration lives in [`components.json`](components.json).

To install additional Shadcnblocks:

```bash
source ~/.config/shadcnblocks.env   # SHADCNBLOCKS_API_KEY
npx shadcn@latest add @shadcnblocks/<block-id>
```

The `@shadcnblocks` registry in `components.json` reads `SHADCNBLOCKS_API_KEY` from the environment. Generate a key at [shadcnblocks.com/dashboard/api](https://shadcnblocks.com/dashboard/api) if needed.

**Note:** The app uses **Tailwind CSS v4** (`@tailwindcss/postcss`) — required for shadcn v4 sidebar layout utilities. `lib/cn.ts` holds the shadcn `cn()` helper. Server-side RSS/dashboard utilities remain in `lib/utils.mjs` (separate module to avoid path conflicts).

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Creative Spark Dashboard — environment variables

Set these before `npm run dev` / `npm start` (or in Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `GIVEBUTTER_API_KEY` | Yes | Bearer token from Givebutter → Settings → Integrations → API |
| `ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Yes | PAT or OAuth token (same as `Workspace/asana/`) |
| `ASANA_SPARKS_PROJECT_GID` | No | Default `1213968849649812` (Creative Sparks) |
| `ASANA_EVENT_STATUS_FIELD_GID` | No | Fallback if Event Status field is renamed |
| `ASANA_FIELD_ALIASES_JSON` | No | JSON override for Asana field/section/status aliases |
| `GIVEBUTTER_SPARK_CAMPAIGN_MATCH` | No | Substring to match Spark campaigns (default `creative-spark`) |
| `GIVEBUTTER_TIER_TAG_ALIASES_JSON` | No | JSON override for tier/honorary tag matching |
| `GIVEBUTTER_ACCOUNT_ID` | Yes (prod) | Numeric Givebutter dashboard account ID for contact profile links (from your dashboard URL, e.g. `145191` in `…/accounts/145191/…`). Not the API account slug. |
| `ASANA_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Recommended (prod) | OAuth refresh token so Vercel can renew `ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN` without the local token file |
| `ASANA_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` | No | OAuth app client ID (default: Creative Waco app) |
| `ASANA_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` | No | OAuth app client secret (default: Creative Waco app) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Yes | Creative Waco Clerk publishable key (not Tortoise & Hare) |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | Creative Waco Clerk secret key |

### Vercel (production)

Local file auto-load does **not** run on Vercel. Set at minimum:

| Variable | Notes |
|----------|--------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Clerk publishable key |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Clerk secret key |
| `GIVEBUTTER_API_KEY` | Givebutter → Settings → Integrations → API |
| `GIVEBUTTER_ACCOUNT_ID` | Numeric ID from dashboard URL (`145191` for Creative Waco) — required for member links |
| `ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Current OAuth access token |
| `ASANA_REFRESH_TOKEN` | From `Workspace/asana/.asana_token.json` after running `scripts/refresh-asana-oauth.mjs` — keeps Asana working when the access token expires |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Creative Waco Clerk publishable key |
| `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` | Creative Waco Clerk secret key |

Optional overrides match the table above (`ASANA_SPARKS_PROJECT_GID`, campaign/tier aliases, etc.).

Example local setup:

```bash
export GIVEBUTTER_API_KEY="..."
export ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN="..."
npm run dev
```

**Local auto-load:** If env vars are unset, the server reads `Workspace/asana/.asana_token.json` and `Archive/givebutter/.env` (API key and `GIVEBUTTER_ACCOUNT_ID`) automatically. Expired OAuth tokens are refreshed using the saved `refresh_token` (updates the token file locally).

**Re-authorize** if automatic refresh fails (revoked app access):

```bash
node scripts/refresh-asana-oauth.mjs
```

Uses the registered callback `http://localhost:3334/oauth/callback`. Sign in when the browser opens and click **Allow** — the script captures the redirect automatically.

Override redirect URI if needed:

```bash
ASANA_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3334/oauth/callback" node scripts/refresh-asana-oauth.mjs
```

**API routes** (trailing slashes match `next.config.ts`):

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/health/` | Health check |
| `GET` | `/api/tools/` | Tool registry JSON |
| `GET` | `/api/sparks-dashboard/` | Dashboard data (`period`, `membershipType`, optional `refresh=1`) |
| `POST` | `/api/generate/` | RSS → HubSpot email HTML |
| `POST` | `/api/event-cards/generate/` | RSS → Instagram-width event card HTML |

## Creative Spark Dashboard

Public-facing dashboard for [Creative Spark](https://creativewaco.org/spark) membership and event pipeline progress.

**Data sources**

- **Givebutter** — active plans plus honorary-only contacts (tier tags without a recurring plan) for tier (gold / silver / bronze) and honorary flag
- **Asana** — [Creative Sparks](https://app.asana.com/1/1211307037171881/project/1213968849649812) project, Events section, `Event Status` custom field

**KPIs**

| KPI | Logic |
|-----|-------|
| Paid members | Active Spark plans (excludes honorary-only contacts); footnote shows honorary + total |
| New paid this period | Paid `memberSince` in selected period; honorary new sign-ups in footnote |
| Events held | Event Status = Done, in period |
| Upcoming events | Event Status = Planning, Marketing, Operations, or Ready with future `due_on` |

**Goals**

- **90 paid members** by Dec 31, 2026 (honorary members tracked separately and excluded from this goal)
- **12 pipeline events** (2/month × 6 months) with dates in Asana

**Tier mix** — paid tiers (warm palette) and honorary tiers (plum palette) in the donut; legend and members table distinguish paid vs honorary. Honorary rows use plum styling; `honorary since` / `expires` dates reflect 1-year stewardship.

**Event Status phases** (from Asana): Idea, Planning, Marketing, Operations, Ready, Follow up, Done, Canceled.

**Schema-tolerant sync** — if Asana field names or enum labels change, the dashboard shows an amber banner with mapping hints (`lib/sparks-dashboard/asana-schema.mjs`) and still renders partial data. Transient API errors appear in the status line only.

**Members tables** — separate **Paid members** and **Honorary members** panels; names shown as first name + last initial only. Only paid members count toward the 90-member goal. Click a member row to open their Givebutter contact profile.

**Spark events table** — upcoming pipeline first (soonest dated events on top), then ideas; completed events are collapsed behind a toggle. Scrollable table body keeps the layout compact.

**Loading** — skeleton placeholders animate while Givebutter and Asana data load (filter changes and **Refresh**). Toolbar filters: period, membership type, and refresh only (no JSON export).

**Chart tooltips** — hover (or keyboard focus) on the growth chart, tier donut/legend, and goal progress bars for custom detail tooltips. Click a month in the growth chart to open a modal with new members and events held that month (names link to Givebutter).

**Privacy** — no MRR, no full names/emails, no RSVP counts.

## Event Card Graphics

1. Fetches `https://creativewaco.org/event/rss.xml` (or any feed URL)
2. Enriches event pages for images and upcoming dates (recommended)
3. Renders **ticket-style Instagram cards** — single white ticket with CSS-mask side notches at the perforation, dashed divider, rounded outer corners, inset photo, category, title, date/time, and venue stub; each card sits on a **blurred version of its event photo**
4. Previews as an **Instagram carousel** (swipe, dots, slide counter); download individual or all PNGs (**1080px wide** at 2× export, includes blurred backdrop), or copy HTML

Layout is **540px** in the tool; export uses 2× pixel ratio. Divider position is synced after layout (`lib/event-cards/sync-ticket-divider.mjs`) so side notches align with the perforation after each photo loads.

Enrichment pulls category, date, venue, and organizer photo from event pages. Events without an image after enrichment are skipped (limit applies after that filter).

## RSS Email HTML Generator

1. Fetches the RSS feed you provide
2. Optionally loads each event page to get the real event date and ticket/organizer website link
3. Filters to upcoming events, sorts, and limits the count
4. Renders list, **2-column**, or **3-column grid** layouts (grids stack to one column on narrow screens)
5. Shows a live preview and copyable HTML

Optional **Include event images** adds thumbnails (list: left of title; grid: card header image).

Grid output includes a `<style>` block with a `@media` query so columns stack on mobile in HubSpot and most email clients.

**Notes**

- **Enrich from event pages** is recommended for Creative Waco events. It reads JSON-LD dates and finds ticket links (OvationTix, PACC, Levitt, etc.).
- Without enrichment, the tool falls back to RSS publish dates and only includes a Learn more button.
- Re-run Generate any time you need fresh HTML for a newsletter send.

## UTM URL Builder

Build tagged destination URLs for Google Analytics and other reporting.

1. Enter the **destination URL** (defaults to `https://creativewaco.org/`) or pick a **destination shortcut** (Home, Events, Spark, About)
2. Pick a **channel preset** (Instagram, Facebook, newsletter, Google Ads, print/QR, partner) — active preset is highlighted; presets include suggested **content variants**
3. Set **campaign name** manually or use the **campaign name helper** (event name + date → slug)
4. Optionally expand **Advanced parameters** (term, content, ID, custom query keys)
5. Add **content variants** to generate multiple `utm_content` links for carousels or A/B placements
6. Copy the live preview (**full URL**, **query string only**, or **path + query** for HubSpot/email), open in a new tab, or copy a **shareable builder link**

**Auto-parse** — paste a full tagged URL into Destination URL; UTM parameters are detected and split into fields automatically.

**Recent campaigns** — last copied campaigns are saved in the browser (up to 10) for quick reload.

**Print / QR preset** — shows a downloadable QR code when the tagged URL is ready.

**Keyboard shortcut** — **⌘⇧C** / **Ctrl+Shift+C** copies the full tagged URL (when focus is not in an input).

**Shareable state** — form values sync to the page URL query string so you can bookmark or Slack a pre-filled link (e.g. `/utm-builder/?url=…&utm_campaign=…`).

**Notes**

- Source, medium, and campaign are required before copy/open is enabled.
- Values are normalized on blur (lowercase, hyphens, special characters removed).
- If the destination already has `utm_*` tags, the tool warns that they will be replaced.
- Custom parameters are appended as non-`utm_` query keys (e.g. `ref=partner-name`).

## Adding a new tool

1. **Registry** — Add an entry to `TOOLS` in [`lib/tools-registry.ts`](lib/tools-registry.ts) (hub and `/api/tools` read from here).
2. **UI** — Add `app/<tool-id>/page.tsx` and a client component under `components/<tool-id>/`. The sidebar picks up new tools automatically from the registry (single **Tools** group; `tag` controls the nav icon). Reuse `PageHero`, `StatusLine`, and globals from `app/globals.css`.
3. **API** (if needed) — Add `app/api/<tool-id>/route.ts` and logic under `lib/<tool-id>/`. Set `export const runtime = "nodejs"` for routes that use filesystem auth or long-running fetches.

Deploy by pushing to `main` on [Creative-Waco/tools](https://github.com/Creative-Waco/tools) (Vercel auto-deploys as a Next.js project). See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.
